# Measures of Central Tendency - Quiz

## Objectives

You will be able to:

* Understand and describe the significance of measuring central tendency of continuous data
* Understand the formula and intuition behind the mean, median, and mode

While we recommend using python to find the answers to these questions, it is not required. You are more than welcome to use a calculator or pencil and paper to solve them, too.
